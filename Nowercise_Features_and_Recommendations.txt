================================================================================
             CANCER-SPECIFIC FEATURE ADDITIONS (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
================================================================================

These features are designed specifically for cancer patients and represent
major differentiators from generic fitness apps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. CONFIDENCE TO MOVE SCORE [PRIORITY 1 - IN DEVELOPMENT]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Track psychological recovery alongside physical metrics

Features to build:
[X] Weekly "Confidence to Move" score tracking
[X] Dashboard widget with trend chart
[ ] Example prompts: "I feel safe moving today", "I trust my body"
[ ] Show trends over time to reinforce psychological progress
[ ] Works even when fitness progress is slow

Why it matters: 
Cancer patients often fear movement. Tracking confidence builds trust
and shows progress even when physical gains are small.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. "WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK" PANEL [PRIORITY 2 - IN DEVELOPMENT]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Treatment-aware intelligence that reduces anxiety

Features to build:
[ ] Dashboard module showing likely symptoms this week
[ ] What movement helps vs what not to push
[ ] Auto-adjust based on chemo cycles, radiotherapy fatigue
[ ] Make intent explicit: "This week is lighter - energy dips expected"

Why it matters:
Reduces anxiety-driven Googling and helps adherence by setting
realistic expectations based on treatment phase.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. RED-AMBER-GREEN BODY SIGNALS [PRIORITY 3 - IN DEVELOPMENT]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Clear safety guidance when logging symptoms

Signal meanings:
- GREEN: "Safe to proceed" - normal feelings, continue as planned
- AMBER: "Proceed with caution" - adapt today's workout, check in
- RED: "Stop and rest" - skip today, seek support if needed

Features to build:
[ ] Color-coded signal on symptom/pain logging
[ ] Each entry links to: what it usually means, what to do today
[ ] Prompts to message specialist when needed
[ ] Educational content for each signal level

Why it matters:
Clear, simple guidance reduces fear and empowers patients to make
safe decisions without needing to contact their specialist every time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. "I HAVE 3 MINUTES" FATIGUE BUTTON [PRIORITY 4 - IN DEVELOPMENT]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Minimum viable movement for low-energy days

Features to build:
[ ] Prominent button on dashboard
[ ] Instant micro-options: seated mobility, breathing, circulation reset
[ ] No planning, no guilt, just safe minimum movement
[ ] Audio-led flow option for cognitive load reduction

Why it matters:
On treatment days or high-fatigue days, patients often skip movement
entirely. This removes barriers and maintains the habit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. ONCOLOGY APPOINTMENT SUMMARY [PRIORITY 5 - IN DEVELOPMENT]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose: Build trust with medical team through clear reporting

Features to build:
[ ] One-tap summary of last 4 weeks
[ ] Activity levels, fatigue trends, pain flags, adherence
[ ] Red flags highlighted for oncologist attention
[ ] Exportable PDF or phone-friendly view
[ ] Clinical language toggle (patient-friendly vs medical terms)

Why it matters:
Patients often forget to share exercise data with oncologists.
This makes it easy and increases clinical trust in the program.
