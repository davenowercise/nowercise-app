Nowercise Project Summary

Nowercise is a comprehensive digital health platform designed specifically for cancer patients and exercise specialists. The platform provides personalized, scientifically-validated exercise programs tailored to individual needs, cancer types, and treatment phases.

Key Features Implemented:

1. Personalized Exercise Recommendation System
   - Integrated ACSM-ACS (American College of Sports Medicine and American Cancer Society) exercise guidelines
   - Created a 4-tier exercise intensity system (from conservative Tier 1 to advanced Tier 4)
   - Implemented cancer-specific considerations for different cancer types
   - Added treatment phase awareness (pre-treatment, during treatment, post-surgery, recovery)
   - Built comorbidity factor adjustments for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis

2. Medical Screening and Safety
   - Implemented PAR-Q+ screening questionnaire to identify patients needing medical clearance
   - Developed a medical clearance guidance page
   - Added symptom tracking and pain monitoring during exercise

3. Exercise Programming
   - Created comprehensive exercise database with filtering by treatment phase
   - Built adaptive workout generation based on patient tier level
   - Implemented varied formats (detailed and streamlined) for workout presentation
   - Added exercise logging with repetition, RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion), and pain tracking

4. Calendar and Scheduling
   - Built interactive 4-week workout calendar showing 12 workout sessions
   - Added color-coding for workout types (strength, cardio, recovery)
   - Implemented workout type filtering
   - Created detailed daily workout pages with exercise videos and logging

5. User Experience
   - Made interface fully mobile-responsive for vertical phone use
   - Added floating action buttons for mobile navigation
   - Implemented email integration for sending workout logs to healthcare providers
   - Created intuitive step-by-step progression through workouts

The platform uses React.js with TypeScript for the frontend, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data management, and integrates specialized components like FullCalendar for workout scheduling.

Next development steps could include:
- Workout completion tracking
- Progress visualization with charts
- Expanded exercise video library
- Notification system for workout reminders
- AI-assisted exercise form feedback
