## ✅ Nowercise Smart Exercise Algorithm – Hybrid Implementation Plan

### 🎯 Purpose
To create a personalised, guideline-informed exercise recommendation engine that:
- Uses cancer-specific + client-reported data
- Suggests an appropriate exercise tier
- Allows the coach (David) to review, approve, and customise the program

This approach combines automation with professional oversight — maximising safety, trust, and personalisation.

---

### 👥 Users Involved
- **Clients**: Complete onboarding and/or daily check-in form
- **Coach (David)**: Reviews algorithm-generated recommendation before program is activated

---

### 🔧 Functional Overview

#### 1. **Client-Facing: Onboarding / Check-in Form**
- Inputs:
  - Age, height, weight, sex
  - Cancer type + treatment history (chemo, radiation, surgery, hormone)
  - Key symptoms (fatigue, dizziness, swelling, neuropathy, etc.)
  - Pain, energy, sleep, confidence scores (1–10)
  - Movement restrictions (tick box: balance, can’t kneel, etc.)
- Submitted to algorithm engine as a profile JSON

#### 2. **Algorithm Engine (Back-End Logic)**
- Scores client across:
  - Mobility
  - Balance
  - Strength readiness
  - Fatigue/risk
  - Confidence level
- Matches score to tier based on exercise guidelines (ACSM/ACS)
- Returns suggested tier (e.g. Tier 1–4) with a description + risk flags

#### 3. **Coach Dashboard (Admin-Only View)**
- View list of submitted clients and their generated recommendations
- Review tier + risk notes (e.g. dizziness flag, low confidence)
- Option to:
  - Approve suggested tier
  - Manually adjust tier
  - Assign specific sessions from library

#### 4. **Client View: Welcome to Your Plan**
- Once approved:
  - Show a simplified message: “We’ve built your gentle start plan”
  - Brief summary of what to expect (e.g. 2x seated sessions + balance work)
  - First video(s) or session card shown with play button

### 🗂 Suggested Routes / Files
- `/onboarding` – client profile entry form
- `/coach-dashboard` – admin review and approval area
- `/plan-review/:id` – single client’s data and tier overview
- `/your-plan` – client-facing plan start screen
- `/data/client-profiles.json` – if stored locally for now

---

### 🛠 Next Steps for Dev
1. Build JSON schema for form + backend logic to assign tier
2. Design layout for coach review panel (toggle, session picker)
3. Set up tier-to-program matching logic (with override option)
4. Create basic front-end “plan summary” for clients
