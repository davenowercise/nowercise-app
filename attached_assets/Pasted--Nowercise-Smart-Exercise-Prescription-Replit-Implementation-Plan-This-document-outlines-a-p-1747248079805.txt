## 🧠 Nowercise Smart Exercise Prescription – Replit Implementation Plan

This document outlines a plan to build a personalised exercise recommendation algorithm into the existing Nowercise Club web app using Replit.

---

### ✅ Objective
To create an intelligent system that uses client data and cancer-specific treatment information to generate safe, individualised workout recommendations based on the latest clinical exercise guidelines.

---

### 🔗 Platform
**Environment:** Replit (React + Node.js or Python-Flask backend)
**Frontend:** Extend existing Nowercise Club interface (Daily Check-ins, Guidelines, Program Selection)
**Backend:** Custom algorithm module that processes client input and returns program recommendations

---

### 📥 Input Data (Client-Provided)
Collected through onboarding forms or Daily Check-in system:

#### Demographic Data:
- Name / ID
- Age
- Height & Weight (to calculate BMI)
- Sex

#### Medical & Treatment Data:
- Cancer Type (e.g. breast, prostate, lymphoma)
- Stage (optional)
- Treatments received (chemo, surgery, radiation, hormone therapy)
- Medications (e.g. Tamoxifen, Zoladex)

#### Symptom & Functional Info:
- Pain level
- Energy, Mood, Sleep (1–10)
- Symptoms: fatigue, dizziness, neuropathy, swelling, anxiety, etc.
- Movement restrictions (balance issues, can’t kneel, etc.)

#### Fitness History:
- Pre-cancer fitness level
- Exercise confidence
- Preferred movement type (optional)

### 🔄 Processing Logic (The Algorithm)

#### Step 1: Red Flag Filtering
- Identify symptoms or treatment factors requiring caution (e.g. lymphedema risk, dizziness, very low energy)
- Automatically restrict program options to safe movements

#### Step 2: Functional Scoring System
- Score each person across:
  - Mobility
  - Strength readiness
  - Balance stability
  - Confidence level
  - Recovery phase

#### Step 3: Match to Guideline-Based Exercise Tier
- Use ACSM + ACS guideline thresholds to categorise user into:
  - Tier 1: Restorative & Seated
  - Tier 2: Gentle + Standing Options
  - Tier 3: Light Strength + Balance
  - Tier 4: Functional Progressive Program

#### Step 4: Build the Weekly Plan
- Pull sessions from existing library (Gentle Sessions, Weekly Movement)
- Adjust based on energy level and symptoms
- Include pacing reminders and optional education prompts

---

### 🔁 Future Enhancements
- Use check-in data trends to auto-adjust programming
- Export check-in logs for clinical use
- Integrate wearable data (e.g. step count, HR)
- Machine learning recommendation engine

---

### 🧪 Next Steps
1. Define data model structure for input form → JSON schema
2. Build rules-based algorithm backend module
3. Create frontend entry form + results page
4. Test plan output logic using 2–3 mock client profiles
