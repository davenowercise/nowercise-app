REPLIT TASK #5: Add “Recovery Phase Banner” to Today Card (UI + Copy)

GOAL
Show the user a calm, reassuring banner on the Today Card that displays:
- their current recovery phase (PROTECT / REBUILD / EXPAND)
- a friendly phase name + one-line meaning
- an optional “Why this phase?” expandable line (uses phase_reason)
This should help users understand the journey and reduce anxiety.

REQUIREMENTS
- Pull phase data from existing endpoint (Task #4): GET /api/phase/status
Response shape:
{
  "recoveryPhase": "REBUILD",
  "stabilityScore": 68,
  "phaseReason": "Moved to REBUILD: stable check-ins over 14 days with low yellow flags."
}

UI PLACEMENT
- Today page (/today) at the top, above the session items.
- Keep it visually calm (no alarming colors). Avoid using red unless the user is in a RED safetyStatus state.

COPY (DISPLAY NAMES + ONE-LINERS)
Map phase to:
1) PROTECT
   Title: "Stabilise & Protect"
   One-liner: "We’re keeping things gentle while your body is dealing with more change."
2) REBUILD
   Title: "Rebuild Capacity"
   One-liner: "We’ll gradually build strength and stamina, staying symptom-led."
3) EXPAND
   Title: "Expand & Return"
   One-liner: "You’re stable enough to expand safely — with flexibility on harder days."

BANNER CONTENT
- Badge: "Your recovery phase"
- Title (from mapping above)
- One-liner (from mapping above)
- Optional small text: "Phase updates automatically based on your recent check-ins."
- Expand/collapse: "Why this phase?" -> shows phaseReason + (optional) stabilityScore

LOGIC
- Always show the banner.
- If todayState.safetyStatus is YELLOW or RED, append a subtle note:
  - YELLOW note: "Today we’re taking it gently based on your check-in."
  - RED note: "Today we’re prioritising safety. Please follow the guidance below."

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Banner appears on /today for all users
- Correct title/one-liner displayed for each phase
- “Why this phase?” reveals phaseReason (and optionally stabilityScore)
- No layout issues on mobile
