Updates requested for Routine UX (Strength A + breathing + video styling)

1) Routine structure / exercise order
- For “Strength” routines, do NOT start with a floor-based breathing exercise.
- Default ordering for Strength routines should be:
  A) Upright warm-in (very light): supported march OR weight shifts (1–2 min)
  B) Main strength block: sit-to-stand / wall push-ups / band pull apart / curls etc
  C) Optional cool-down: BREATH or gentle mobility at the end
- Rule: BREATH exercises should be placed at the END of a strength routine by default (cool-down / reset), unless the routine is explicitly a “Breath + Reset” session.

2) Breathing guidance (duration + instruction)
- For breathing exercises, replace “reps/sets” language with duration-based guidance.
- For Lying Long Exhale Breathing:
  - Display: “Do this for ~60–120 seconds (or 5–10 slow breaths).”
  - Add: “Stop sooner if it feels uncomfortable. Small and steady is perfect.”
- If you need a single standard: default breathing duration = 90 seconds (with option to do shorter).

3) Logging rules by exercise type
- BREATH:
  - Do NOT ask “How many reps did you do?”
  - Instead show a simple completion logging option:
    - “How long did you do?” (optional)
      - 30s / 60s / 90s / 2 min / Skip
  - Or simplest: just “Mark as done” (no numeric logging required).
- MOBILITY:
  - No reps required; optional “Did you do a little / enough / more?” or just “Done”.
- STRENGTH:
  - Keep reps/sets logging (as you already do).

4) Restyle embedded YouTube player (make it feel native + premium)
- Remove any visible border/frame/padding around the embedded player.
- Make the video full-bleed within the exercise card container (while preserving card padding elsewhere).
- Apply consistent rounded corners to match the UI (12–16px radius).
- Use a fixed 16:9 aspect ratio.
- Add a subtle shadow to match card style.
- If possible, minimize YouTube UI chrome (hide related videos, modest branding, etc).
- Ensure the player does not cause layout jump when loading.

5) Safety fallback
- If filtering leaves too few exercises to build a session, fall back to a short session that ends with BREATH (video_url present) rather than failing or showing blank.

Outcome I want:
- Strength sessions feel like strength from the first exercise
- Breathing feels like a supportive reset at the end
- Video playback looks like in-app content, not an external embed
- Breathing logging matches the nature of the exercise (time/breaths, not reps)
