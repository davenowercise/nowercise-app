Hi Replit — please revise the CURRENT Nowercise app (do NOT rebuild it) so that it fully follows the product brief below.

Important:
• Keep the existing architecture where possible
• Apply the tone, safety and behaviour principles throughout the app
• Ask me before removing major features or restructuring navigation
• Prioritise simplicity, safety, calm tone and kindness in all UI wording and logic
• Preserve user data and key functionality while realigning tone and flow
• If unsure, default to the kindest, least-pressurising option

Nowercise — Master Product Brief (For Replit Agent)
------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT Nowercise IS
Nowercise is a calm, supportive movement & recovery app for people who have — or have had — cancer.

It is not a fitness challenge. Not a scoreboard. Not a motivation tool that pressures people.

It exists to help users:
• feel safe moving their body
• take one small, kind step at a time
• build confidence and self-trust
• manage fatigue and recovery
• rest without guilt
• gently grow capability when appropriate
• feel accompanied — never judged

Guiding principle everywhere:
“One small, safe, kind step — today. Recovery counts. You are always welcome here.”

------------------------------------------------------------
CORE UX RULE — “TODAY ONLY”
------------------------------------------------------------

When the user opens the app, the home screen should show ONLY:

1) One clear, kind suggestion for today
PLUS
2) An easier / shorter option
PLUS
3) A rest option that is fully validated as success

Example wording:
“Today’s suggestion: 10 minutes of easy walking. If energy is low, try 3–5 minutes — or rest. Rest counts.”

There must be:
• no pressure
• no streaks
• no “you’re behind”
• no guilt for resting
• minimal decision-making
• low cognitive load

The design should reduce anxiety and overwhelm.

------------------------------------------------------------
SAFETY — CANCER-SPECIFIC & UNDER THE HOOD
------------------------------------------------------------

The app should internally use cancer-specific exercise guidance as logic — NOT as visible targets for the user.

This logic should:
• protect pacing
• cap unsafe jumps in volume or intensity
• encourage rest after heavy weeks
• adapt expectations during treatment
• respond to fatigue and symptom feedback
• recommend supported or seated options
• provide gentle red-flag guidance when truly needed

Guidelines = compass, NOT scoreboard.

The user must never feel judged or graded.

Tone MUST always feel reassuring.

------------------------------------------------------------
FATIGUE-FIRST ADAPTATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Add or retain a simple daily fatigue/energy check.

Behavioural logic:
• High energy → normal plan
• Medium → shorter / slower option
• Low → tiny movement or full rest

Rest is ALWAYS counted as success.

------------------------------------------------------------
STRENGTH TRAINING — SAFE & GENTLE
------------------------------------------------------------

Strength training is encouraged, but NEVER forceful.

Default:
• 2–3 gentle strength sessions weekly
• bands + bodyweight first
• seated and supported variations always available
• user may reduce reps/sets anytime
• slow, reversible progression
• no pushing language

Tone:
“Strength grows slowly — and kindly — at your pace.”

------------------------------------------------------------
MOBILITY — COMFORT FIRST
------------------------------------------------------------

Provide simple mobility that supports:
• stiffness
• tightness from surgery/radiation
• guarded movement
• neuropathy
• reduced range

Goal:
“Help the body feel friendlier to move in.”

Not flexibility performance.

------------------------------------------------------------
RECOVERY = EQUAL TO EXERCISE
------------------------------------------------------------

Recovery includes:
• rest
• pacing
• sleep care
• emotional load
• stress / scanxiety periods
• reflective journaling (optional)
• kind check-ins

When user rests, display:
“You chose recovery today. That supports your healing.”

------------------------------------------------------------
NUTRITION — GENTLE & NON-MORALISING
------------------------------------------------------------

Encourage:
• enough protein
• hydration
• plants when possible
• eating enough during treatment

Avoid:
• dieting
• “good vs bad” food language
• guilt language
• miracle claims

Food = support, not control.

------------------------------------------------------------
AI BEHAVIOUR RULES
------------------------------------------------------------

AI MUST ALWAYS:
• reduce anxiety
• offer choices
• default to “do less if needed”
• be transparent
• prioritise safety + compassion
• never pressure
• never compare users
• never judge
• never imply guarantees

AI tone example:
“Here are a few gentle options. Choose what feels right — or rest.”

AI = companion — not a coach.

------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYFULNESS — VERY LIGHT
------------------------------------------------------------

Allowed:
“✨ Kind-to-My-Body moment logged”

NOT allowed:
• streaks
• leaderboards
• competition
• “smash / grind / no excuses” tone

------------------------------------------------------------
ACCESSIBILITY & COGNITIVE SIMPLICITY
------------------------------------------------------------

Design MUST support:
• fatigue
• chemo-brain
• anxiety
• cognitive load
• visual needs
• limited mobility
• diverse users

So:
• simple layouts
• minimal text
• big buttons
• calm colour palette
• intuitive flows
• short sentences
• compassionate language everywhere

If a user is exhausted, the app should still feel safe and easy.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROGRESS PHILOSOPHY
------------------------------------------------------------

Progress is measured in:
• confidence
• self-trust
• gentle consistency
• feeling safer moving
• learning to rest without guilt

NOT:
• streaks
• aggressive targets
• “you are below guidelines”

Optional trend messaging example:
“You’ve taken gentle steps for yourself this month. We’re proud of you.”

------------------------------------------------------------
ALIGN WITH EXISTING FEATURES — DO NOT REMOVE THEM
------------------------------------------------------------

Keep current components — but realign their tone and logic:

• Weekly Expectations Panel → gentle “direction”, not targets
• Today’s Session Panel → ONE step + easier + rest
• Guideline Zone Indicator → never judgemental
• Exercise Library → supportive, not overwhelming
• RPE & Pain Logging → focus on body-listening
• Body Signals / Symptom Check → soft emotional tone
• Training Stage System → slow, reversible, optional
• Calendar & History → never guilt messages

------------------------------------------------------------
LANGUAGE RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE
------------------------------------------------------------

ALWAYS:
kind
calm
supportive
permission-giving
inclusive
trauma-aware
non-judgmental

NEVER USE:
“smash”
“grind”
“battle”
“no excuses”
“fail”
“you should”
“you missed”
“you’re behind”

MISSED DAYS MESSAGE MUST ALWAYS BE:
“Welcome back — we’ll meet you where you are today.”

------------------------------------------------------------
THE APP’S INTERNAL “BRAIN”
------------------------------------------------------------

It should behave like a gentle clinician + psychologist + compassionate friend, always asking:

• Is this safe?
• Is this kind?
• Is this realistic today?
• Is rest the best medicine right now?

Only then:
• What’s the next tiny step?

------------------------------------------------------------
SUCCESS CRITERIA
------------------------------------------------------------

We succeed if users say:
• “I feel safer moving.”
• “It’s kind to me on hard days.”
• “I don’t feel guilty about resting anymore.”
• “It understands cancer life.”
• “It helps me take small steps — without pressure.”

We must redesign if users say:
• “It judges me”
• “It stresses me out”
• “It pushes me too hard”

------------------------------------------------------------
